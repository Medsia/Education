Make a description of the class of a polynomial of the form ax^2 + bx +c . Provide methods that implement: calculation of the value of a polynomial for a given argument;
the operation of addition, subtraction and multiplication of polynomials to obtain a new object-a polynomial; displaying a description of the polynomial on the screen.
Write a program that demonstrates all the developed elements of the class.the number of summed terms of the series and the value of the function.
