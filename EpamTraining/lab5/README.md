Develop three console applications that implement tasks by options. For tasks 1 and 2, a one-dimensional real array of n elements is given, and for task 3,
a real rectangular matrix n * m is given. Process all possible situations that arise when solving your problem.

1. Find the sum of the modules of the array elements located after the first negative element.
2. Sort the array elements in descending order to the first element equal to zero.
3. Find the sum of the elements in those rows that contain at least one negative element
